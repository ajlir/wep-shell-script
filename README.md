# wep-shell-script
A shell script to startup my wireless adapter and connect it to a WEP network


What it does:
* Setting up wireless interface with network ID and password using iwconfig
* Set wireless interface link to up.
* Use dhcpcd for setting up Internet connection.

I didn't put any elevated privileges on the script but it is required.
